MBTA Schedule
---

This is a display board showing the status of 14 trains that will depart the soonest.
It can be easily modified to show greater or fewer trains.
It also updates itself every 30 seconds.

All data is being pulled from the csv file that the MBTA publishes.  I am assuming all that data is valid.

It uses nodejs, mongodb, react, react-bootstrap-table, webpack, babel, and a few other opensource tools
